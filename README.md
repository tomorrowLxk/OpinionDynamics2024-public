# OpinionDynamics2024-public

This is the public version of the code for the paper **"A Cooperative Decision-making Method for CAVs from the Perspective of Opinion Dynamics"**. The implementation includes a support vector machine (SVM) module and a static single-step motion planner.

The full workflow is organized into several components within this repository.  
Note that the original and complete project is built upon **TESSNG**, a commercial traffic simulation platform. Due to licensing restrictions, the full project cannot be made publicly available.

This work has been accepted and published in *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies (TRC)*. If you find this code or the associated methodology useful in your research, we would greatly appreciate it if you could cite our paper.
